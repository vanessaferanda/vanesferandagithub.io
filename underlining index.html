        <h6>Underlining is another typewriter habit. Typewriters had no bold or italic styling. So the only way to emphasize text was to back up the carriage and put underscores beneath the text. It was a workaround for shortcomings in typewriter technology.</h6>

      <h2>Your word processor doesn’t suffer from these shortcomings. If you feel the urge to underline, use bold or italic instead. In special situations, like headings, you can also consider using all caps, small caps, or changing the point size.</h2>
      <h2>Not convinced? I invite you to find a book, newspaper, or magazine that underlines text. Aside from supermarket tabloids—was that the look you were going for?—you won’t find any.</h2>

        <h2>The “track changes” feature of your word processor will underline text added to the document. This is fine. In fact, it’s one more reason not to use underlining for emphasis— so that it won’t be confused with revision marks.</h2>
        <h2>“But the Bluebook requires underlining.” No, it doesn’t. In its rules for practitioners, the Bluebook chooses to “keep the tradition of underscoring certain text”, but practitioners “may substitute italics wherever underscoring is used”. Bluebook at 3 (20th ed. 2015). In later rules, whereas the 19th edition said to “underscore (or italicize)”, the 20th edition says to “italicize (or underscore)”. (For instance, Bluebook rule B2.) These are the details that make each new edition of the Bluebook so compelling.</h2>
